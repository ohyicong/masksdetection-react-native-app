/**
 * Factory function for BundleResource IOHandler.
 *
 * This `IOHandler` only supports `load`. It is designed to support
 * loading models that have been statically bundled (at compile time)
 * with an app.
 *
 * This IOHandler is not compatible with managed expo apps.
 *
 * ```js
 *  const modelJson = require('../path/to/model.json');
 *  const modelWeights = require('../path/to/model_weights.bin');
 *  async function bundleResourceIOExample() {
 *    const model =
 *      await tf.loadLayersModel(bundleResourceIO(modelJson, modelWeights));
 *
 *     const res = model.predict(tf.randomNormal([1, 28, 28, 1])) as tf.Tensor;
 *  }
 * ```
 *
 * @param modelJson The JSON object for the serialized model.
 * @param modelWeightsId An identifier for the model weights file. This is
 * generally a resourceId or a path to the resource in the app package.
 * This is typically obtained with a `require` statement.
 *
 * See
 * facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/images#static-non-image-resources
 * for more details on how to include static resources into your react-native
 * app including how to configure `metro` to bundle `.bin` files.
 *
 * @returns An instance of `IOHandler`
 *
 * @doc {heading: 'Models', subheading: 'IOHandlers'}
